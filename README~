Documentation for Unix tail
=====================================

+-------+
| BUILD |
+-------+
put Makefile, tail.h tail.c under the same directory,
> make clean
> make 
> ./tail [-h / -f] ... [FILE] ...

+-------+
| TESTS |
+-------+
Test environment: Ubuntu 12.04 in VirtualBox
Explaination: 
1. To test -f, you need to add new lines into file "test", then save it, then you can see the result in terminal. It updates one second a time.
2. Use interrupt:control+c to terminate the process.

> ./tail test
> ./tail test test
> ./tail -n 5 test
> ./tail -n 15 test
> ./tail -n 25 test
> ./tail -n 5 test test
> ./tail -n 10 -n -5 test
> ./tail -n 10 -n -5 test test
> ./tail -f test
> ./tail -n 5 -f test
> ./tail -n 5 test -f
> ./tail -f test test

+------+
| BUGS |
+------+
There was a bug in gedit, which added a new '\n' in test file. It took a while to fix it.

+-------+
| OTHER |
+-------+
For the purpose of argument "-f", all input files should be treated in a single process, thus we can check the results in a clear way. So, an improvement of my solution is to use multi-threading.
